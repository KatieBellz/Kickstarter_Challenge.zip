# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns based on various factors such as launch dates and funding goals. By identifying trends and patterns, the analysis helps to understand what contributes to the success or failure of a campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis revealed trends that indicate when it may be most beneficial to launch a campaign. For example, campaigns launched in May tend to have a higher success rate compared to other months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data showed that campaigns with funding goals under $1,000 had a greater chance of success. This suggests that setting lower goals could improve the likelihood of reaching funding targets.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While conducting the analysis, one limitation of the dataset was observed. The dataset provided limited information, which made it difficult to draw specific conclusions about certain campaign types, such as sports or games, due to the lack of detailed data.

## Results

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the outcomes based on launch date?**  
  It was concluded that launching a campaign in May tends to result in higher success rates. Additionally, the data suggested that the failure rate did not vary significantly based on launch date, indicating other factors could be influencing outcomes.
  
- **What can you conclude about the outcomes based on goals?**  
  Campaigns with funding goals under $1,000 were more likely to succeed. Setting a lower funding goal could be a strategic approach to improving success rates.

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?**  
  The dataset was limited in its ability to provide detailed insights. For example, there was no information on the type of sports or games played in each campaign, making it difficult to perform a more granular analysis.

- **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created?**  
  Future analyses could include tables or graphs that compare success rates across different campaign categories, compare success rates by the day of the week, or analyze how campaign duration affects the outcome.
